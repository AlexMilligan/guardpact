## Post 1: Introduce GuardPact lightly
*(don’t lead with the site yet — let curiosity build)*

Thread: “Most political fighting is fake. 90%+ of people want the same 5 things from government. The fight is only about means. Here are the 5 ends almost everyone already agrees on (with polling links). Tomorrow: a filter that forces every policy to serve all 5 — or die.”
→ Next day drop the one-pager graphic of the 5 goals + circuit-breakers concept.

## Post 2: Score a hot current policy against the 5 goals
Pick something timely (e.g., new spending bill, immigration proposal, AI regulation, housing policy).
Simple format:
“Policy X claims to do Y.
- Goal 1 ✓
- Goal 2 ✗ (here’s the data)
- Goal 3 ✓
- Goal 4 ✗
- Goal 5 ✗
Verdict: auto-reject or needs circuit-breaker.
We have the tech to make this automatic. More soon.”

## Post 3-5: Skeptical one-liners that fit your first post’s vibe
- “The coordination problem isn’t that we disagree on goals. It’s that our current system rewards pretending we do.”
- “Every empire dies of legacy bloat. Sunsetting laws after 10 years unless re-proven useful is the simplest circuit-breaker humanity never implemented.”
- “Prediction markets + citizen juries already exist. We just refuse to use them because the results would embarrass someone powerful.”

## Post 6-7: Meta observations on incentives
*(your first post was perfect for this)*
- "Good ideas spread virally. Bad ideas need marketing budgets and outrage engines. If your reform requries a PR firm, it's probably wrong."
- "The Overton window is controlled by whoever controls the loudest microphones, not by what actually works."

## Medium-term threads / mini-models (1-2 months out)
These are the "mental tools" people will screenshot and quote.
- How the 5 goals create a natural "political Coase theorem" - low-transaction-cost bargaining ends up satisfying all 5.
- "State Labs" thread: 50-state experiments are the biggest free energy in governance. List 5 current examples that already shifted national consensus (weed, school choice, etc.).
- A simple scoring rubric (0-10) for each goal so anyone can evaluate a policy in <10 minutes. Release as a free Notion template / Google sheet.
- "Why most policy debates are actually empirical questions in disguise" - with 10 examples where the experiment has already been run somewhere on earth.

## Longer-term projects that aren't only about government (but still advance mindkind)
You’re right that government is the highest-leverage place to inject better decision engines, but you can branch into parallel tools that feel less political and spread faster in rationalist / tech / everyday circles.

1. **Mindkind Decision Engine** (non-political version of GuardPact)
Same exact structure, but for personal / company / community decisions.
5 universal goals most humans actually share (e.g., longevity/health, truth-seeking, prosperity, relationships, optionality).
Turn it into a free web app: input any life decision → it scores against all 5 → suggests circuit-breakers (“revisit in 6 months if metric X drops”).
This spreads virally among rationalists, founders, EAs without triggering political filters.

2. **Viral “Circuit-Breaker” micro-tools**
- A browser extension that auto-sunsets your own beliefs: flags any strong opinion you haven’t re-examined in >2 years.
- Commitment contracts marketplace (like Beeminder + prediction markets) for personal policy changes.

3. **Coordination tech for small groups** (huge untapped mindkind leverage)
Most good ideas die because 3–15 people can’t coordinate cleanly.
Build tiny tools:
- Anonymous preference aggregation for friend groups / DAOs / companies that reveals Pareto frontiers instead of majority vote.
- “Policy gradient descent” bot for group chats: proposes tiny experiments to resolve recurring arguments.

4. **Meme-level redirections**
Short threads translating academic papers into plain English + one surprising implication.
Topics:
-Modest proposals that actually work (e.g., approval voting, quadratic funding, futarchy pilots).
-Why most expertise is fake and how to detect it in 90 seconds.
-The 4 reliable ways civilizations have ever fixed runaway corruption (hint: all involve skin in the game + automatic triggers).

5. **The “Mindkind Upgrade List”**
A running public list (site or just pinned thread) of the 20–30 institutional technologies humanity already invented but refuses to use (prediction markets, sortition, challenge trials, commitment contracts, etc.).
One new entry per month with evidence it works somewhere + exact implementation steps.
