## Core principles guiding this plan:

- Tax extraction/spending over production/saving/investment → rewards compounding.
- Smooth progressivity on total consumption (not item tiers) → fair without gaming/distortion.
- Close loopholes at transfer/death points → curb dynastic capture without annual wealth/unrealized taxes.
- Minimize admin complexity → leverage digital banking/IRS data for auto-calc.
- Revenue-neutral-ish starting point → swap income/FICA for consumption base + targeted fixes.
- Second-order: Avoid flight (consumption less portable), boost labor/investment incentives, fund UBS basics (education/healthcare/infra) as welfare floor.

## Proposed 2026-Optimal Tax System Outline (phased over 5–10 years for transition)

1. Shift primary base to progressive personal expenditure/consumption tax (80%+ of goal: growth + fairness)
  - Annual filing: AGI - verified savings/investments (401k/IRA/HSA/brokerage auto-reported) - large standard deduction (~$40–50k family for basics) = taxable consumption.
  - Apply smooth graduated marginal rates on taxable consumption: e.g., 5% on first $20k, ramp gradually to 15–20% mid, 30–45% at very high spend (top 0.1%).
  - Prebate/rebate for basics (universal cash covering median essentials) → nets low spenders near-zero or positive.
  - Phase out FICA/payroll taxes (7.65% employee hit) + most individual income tax brackets → consumption base taxes what’s taken out, not put in.
  - Why optimal now: Digital tracking trivial (apps/IRS integration); rewards compounding (savings untaxed until spent); progressive via spend patterns; no item-price tiers → companies price on value, not tax brackets.

2. Fix wealth-transfer leaks without broad wealth/unrealized tax (avoids flight/punishing holding)
  - Eliminate/reform step-up in basis at death → treat death as realization event for gains above threshold (e.g., $5–10M exemption), with deferral/installments for illiquids + life insurance offsets. Captures ~$200–400B/decade progressively.
  - Strengthen estate/gift tax: Keep ~$15M 2026 exemption (post-OBBBA), but close GRAT/loopholes; add portability tweaks.
  - No annual wealth/unrealized gains tax — portable capital flees (Norway/France/CA evidence); focus proceeds/transfer points.

3. Corporate/business side for growth (incentivize investment)
  - Permanent full expensing (OBBBA started this) → extend to structures/factories.
  - Graduated corporate rates if needed (e.g., 15–18% small/mid, up to 25–28% mega-profits) → curbs concentration without killing startups.
  - Keep Pillar Two global minimum → reduces race-to-bottom.

4. Retain/expand targeted fairness tweaks (build on OBBBA wins)
  - Permanent no-tax on overtime/tips (up to $25k joint) + auto-loan interest deduction.
  - UBS floor funded from new base: Free/near-free education/healthcare basics → removes poverty traps without cash UBI leaks.
