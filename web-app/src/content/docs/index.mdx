**“Protect. Fair Shot. One Rule. Real Results. Smart Freedom.”**  
Your family is safe. Your kid has a real chance. Same rules for all. Policies that work. Freedom with brakes.

What if government wasn't about endless debates or tribal loyalties? What if it was just a smart, self-correcting shield that protects you, gives everyone a fair start, and gets out of your way?

That's the Guard Pact. It's not an ideology—it's a **governance filter** designed to help you decide what's best for our nation. It provides **how to decide**, using 5 measurable goals that the vast majority of Americans already agree on, as shown in polls: liberty (94% say Constitution is important for it) and rule of law (96% agree it's central to the country's future).

- **Protect your life & safety**
- **Give every kid a fair shot**
- **One rulebook for all**
- **Evidence over experts**
- **Maximum liberty with circuit-breakers**

Every policy must pass **ALL 5**—or it's out. This ensures everything works for you.

## The 5 Universal High-Level Goals (HLGs)
These resonate with the vast majority of Americans—no ideology, just the protection, equal rules, and progress you deserve.

| HLG | One-Liner | Core Principle |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| **1. Protect Life & Safety** | Every citizen like you is secure — from crime, invasion, or collapse. | **Shield First** |
| **2. Fair Shot for Every Kid** | No child’s future is decided by zip code, income, or identity—giving your kids the start they need. | **Opportunity Egalitarianism** |
| **3. One Rulebook for All** | Same laws, same consequences — no exceptions, no side doors for anyone. | **Impartial Rule of Law** |
| **4. Evidence Over Experts** | Policies live or die by real-world results that affect you—not theories or lobbyists. | **Empirical Governance** |
| **5. Sustainable Liberty** | Maximum freedom for you — with automatic brakes when harm or waste is proven. | **Liberty with Circuit-Breakers** |

## 19 Essential, Evidence-Backed Policies
Practical policies tied to these goals—from school choice to nuclear power. All with sunsets and circuit-breakers.

| # | Policy | Key Win for You |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Universal School Choice** | $15k per child, so you can pick any accredited school that fits your family. |
| 4 | **Shall-Issue Concealed Carry** | Self-defense as your civil right + $200 training credit to keep you safe. |
| 9 | **17% Flat Consumption Tax** | Tax what you spend, not what you earn—with a prebate for essentials to ease your burden. |
| 14 | **All-In Nuclear + Carbon Dividend** | 200 reactors by 2040; every carbon dollar returned directly to you. |
| 18 | **Prediction Markets + Citizen Juries** | Let data beat out dogma; 100 random citizens like you veto overreach. |

## Why It Works for You
- **Self-Correcting**: Sunsets, circuit-breakers, opt-outs—if it doesn't serve you, it's gone.
- **State Labs**: Divisive issues become experiments where data decides.
- **No Bloat**: Government shields you, unblocks opportunities, steps aside.

Polls show 90%+ approval for core ideas like these.
