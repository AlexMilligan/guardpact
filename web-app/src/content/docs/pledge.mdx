"I want a government built on evidence, not ideology. I support the <strong>Guard Pact's <a href="/docs/01-hlg/">5 High-Level Goals</a></strong> and its core mechanics for accountability: mandatory sunset clauses, <a href="/docs/04-reference/circuit-breaker-catalog/">circuit-breakers</a> on new restrictions, <a href="/docs/02-essential-points/18-prediction-juries/">citizen juries</a>, and competitive <a href="/docs/03-state-labs/">state labs</a>."

- **You become a Guardian.** Your first name and state are added to our public counter.
- **You stay informed.** We'll send brief, high-signal updates on major milestones. No spam.
- **We build leverage.** At critical mass, we deliver the Pact to Congress and all presidential candidates as a clear mandate from the American people.
