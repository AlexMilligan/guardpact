These 5 goals aren't left or right—they're what the vast majority of Americans agree government should do. Backed by data, not dogma. Polls show strong consensus: 81% of Americans think crime is a major concern in cities, 73% support school choice open to all families, 83% believe the president must honor Supreme Court rulings, 74% favor federal investments in scientific research, and 72% are satisfied with their freedom to choose what to do with their lives.

## **THE 5 HIGH-LEVEL GOALS (HLGs)**  
*Each is **self-evidently necessary**, **measurable**, and **non-partisan**.*

| **HLG**                        | **One-Liner**                                                             | **Why It Resonates (Left + Right + Center)**                                                          | **Core Principle**                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **1. Protect Life & Safety**   | *Every citizen is secure — from crime, invasion, or collapse.*            | **Left**: Anti-violence. **Right**: Law & order. **Center**: Basic duty. (81% think crime major concern in cities)                             | **Shield First**                  |
| **2. Fair Shot for Every Kid** | *No child’s future is decided by zip code, income, or identity.*          | **Left**: Anti-poverty. **Right**: Merit. **Center**: Common sense. (73% support school choice for all)                                  | **Opportunity Egalitarianism**    |
| **3. One Rulebook for All**    | *Same laws, same consequences — no exceptions, no side doors.*            | **Left**: Anti-cronyism. **Right**: Anti-special treatment. **Center**: Blind justice. (83% say honor courts)               | **Impartial Rule of Law**         |
| **4. Evidence Over Experts**   | *Policies live or die by real-world results — not theories or lobbyists.* | **Left**: Anti-corporate capture. **Right**: Anti-bureaucracy. **Center**: Data > dogma. (74% support scientific research investment)             | **Empirical Governance**          |
| **5. Sustainable Liberty**     | *Maximum freedom — with automatic brakes when harm or waste is proven.*   | **Left**: Guardrails for climate/drugs. **Right**: Sunset clauses. **Center**: Freedom with feedback. (72% value personal freedoms) | **Liberty with Circuit-Breakers** |


### How the HLGs Filter Policies

Here's how every policy must pass all 5 HLGs—or it's out:

    A[Proposed Policy] --> B{Check HLG 1: Protect?}
    B -->|Yes| C{Check HLG 2: Fair Shot?}
    B -->|No| Z[Reject]
    C -->|Yes| D{Check HLG 3: One Rulebook?}
    C -->|No| Z
    D -->|Yes| E{Check HLG 4: Evidence-Based?}

    E -->|Yes| F{Check HLG 5: Sustainable Liberty?}
    E -->|No| Z
    F -->|Yes| G[Approve with Circuit-Breakers]
    F -->|No| Z
```

### What about...
> - **Equity?** Only when **data proves it advances HLG #2** (e.g., progressive tax on scalable corporations funds HLG #2). **Never a goal.** [See Chetty's research on zip code outcomes](https://opportunityinsights.org/).
> - **Assimilation?** A *natural outcome* of HLG #3 — not a headline.  
> - **Protection?** HLG #1 is **explicit** — government’s **first job**.
> - **Environment?** HLG #5 includes sustainability brakes, like carbon dividends in Point #14.
> - **Economy?** HLG #4 ensures policies are tested by results, not theories—e.g., prediction markets in Point #18 [Inspired by Tetlock's Superforecasting](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23946670-superforecasting).
> - **Innovation?** HLG #2 and #5 promote fair shots and liberty, fostering tech and AI progress without overreach.
