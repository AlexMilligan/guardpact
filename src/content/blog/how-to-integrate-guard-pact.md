This guide walks you through **exactly what to do** to make the **Guard Pact** the operating system of American governance — **without rewriting the Constitution from scratch**.

---

## Step 1: Pass the **Guard Pact Act** (Federal Statute)

**Goal**: Require every federal bill and regulation to pass the **5 HLG Scorecard**.

### Actions
1. **Draft the bill** (use template below).
2. **Find 5 bipartisan sponsors** (2R, 2D, 1I) in House + Senate.
3. **Add to committee markup** via Rules Committee (House) or unanimous consent (Senate).
4. **Pass via reconciliation** (budget-related: tax, healthcare, energy policies).

```markdown
### Sample Bill Text (Guard Pact Act)
> **Section 1**: All proposed federal legislation, regulations, and executive actions must include a **5 HLG Scorecard** certifying passage of all five High-Level Goals.  
> **Section 2**: The Office of Empirical Governance (OEG) is established to score and publish results.  
> **Section 3**: Any policy failing any HLG is null and void upon judicial review.  
> **Section 4**: Sunset clauses mandatory unless reauthorized with evidence.
```

**Timeline**: Introduce in **January 2026** → Pass by **July 2026**.

## Step 2: Issue **Day 1 Executive Order**

**Goal**: Enforce HLG review on all new federal regulations.

### Actions

1. **President signs EO** on Inauguration Day (Jan 20, 2026 or 2029).
2. **Mandate OEG review** for every rule in Federal Register.
3. **Pause all non-HLG-compliant regs** within 90 days.


```markdown
### Sample EO Language
> “All agencies shall submit a 5 HLG justification for any proposed rule. Rules failing any HLG are withdrawn.”
```

---

## Step 3: Launch **Charter Cities** in 10 States

**Goal**: Create real-world policy labs using **Point #17**.

### Actions

|State|Action|Lead|
|---|---|---|
|TX, FL, AZ, NV, TN|Pass **State Charter Cities Act**|State Reps + YIMBY groups|
|CA, CO, UT, NC, OH|Voter initiative (ballot measure)|Citizen coalitions|

**Template law**: 5 cities, 50k+ pop, opt-in tax/zoning/school rules. Federal matching funds if HLG metrics improve.

---

## Step 4: Push **Constitutional Amendment** (Article XXVIII)

**Goal**: Make Guard Pact **permanent and supreme**.

### Actions

1. **34 states call** for Article V convention (focus: “Guard Pact Amendment”).
2. **Draft single article** (see below).
3. **Ratify in 38 states** within 7 years.



```markdown
### Article XXVIII — The Guard Pact
> All laws must advance **all five High-Level Goals (HLGs)**:  
> 1. Protect Life & Safety  
> 2. Fair Shot for Every Kid  
> 3. One Rulebook for All  
> 4. Evidence Over Experts  
> 5. Sustainable Liberty  
>  
> Congress shall define metrics. Sunset clauses and state labs are mandatory.
```

---

## Step 5: Enforce via **Courts + Citizen Juries**

### Actions

- **SCOTUS precedent**: Cite Article XXVIII to strike legacy laws.
- **Citizen lawsuits**: Use HLG failure as **standing**.
- **Point #18**: Fund CFTC-regulated prediction markets + 100-citizen juries to veto new bans.

---

## Step 6: Sunset 90% of Federal Code

**Goal**: Force reauthorization under HLGs.

### Actions

1. **Pass Sunset Omnibus Act** (2027).
2. **All non-HLG laws expire** in 5 years unless re-passed.
3. **OEG publishes “Dead Law Report”** annually.
