**“Protect. Fair Shot. One Rule. Real Results. Smart Freedom.”**  
Your family is safe. Your kid has a real chance. Same rules for all. Policies that work. Freedom with brakes.

What if government wasn't about endless debates or tribal loyalties? What if it was just a smart, self-correcting shield that protects you, gives everyone a fair start, and gets out of your way?

That's the Guard Pact. It's not an ideology pushing beliefs on you—it's a **governance filter**, a decision engine designed to help you decide what's best for our nation. It doesn't dictate *what you should want*. Instead, it gives you **how to decide**, using 5 measurable, self-evident goals that over 90% of Americans—like you—already agree on:

- **Protect your life & safety**
- **Give every kid a fair shot**
- **One rulebook for all of us**
- **Evidence over experts**
- **Maximum liberty with circuit-breakers**

Think of it like a firewall protecting your computer—not a flag you wave. 

- An **ideology** might say: “This is good because my group believes it.”
- The **Guard Pact** asks: “Does this pass all 5 filters? And if the data shows it failing, do we fix it or kill it right away?”

It's anti-fragile pragmatism built for you: No sacred cows. No permanent power grabs. Just a shield for your safety, fairness for your family, and forward motion for our country—constantly tested by real-world results.

In essence, it's like a bug bounty program for government. Spot a flaw in a policy? We fix or scrap it—no emotions, no excuses. This keeps government efficient, supportive, and always moving you forward.

## The 5 Universal High-Level Goals (HLGs)
These resonate with over 90% of Americans just like you—no ideology, just the protection, fairness, and progress you deserve.

| HLG | One-Liner | Core Principle |
|-----|-----------|----------------|
| **1. Protect Life & Safety** | Every citizen like you is secure — from crime, invasion, or collapse. | **Shield First** |
| **2. Fair Shot for Every Kid** | No child’s future is decided by zip code, income, or identity—giving your kids the start they need. | **Opportunity Egalitarianism** |
| **3. One Rulebook for All** | Same laws, same consequences — no exceptions, no side doors for anyone. | **Impartial Rule of Law** |
| **4. Evidence Over Experts** | Policies live or die by real-world results that affect you—not theories or lobbyists. | **Empirical Governance** |
| **5. Sustainable Liberty** | Maximum freedom for you — with automatic brakes when harm or waste is proven. | **Liberty with Circuit-Breakers** |

Every policy has to pass **ALL 5** to make the cut—or it's out. This ensures everything works for you.

## 18 Essential, Evidence-Backed Policies
We've got practical policies tailored to these goals—from universal school choice to help your kids thrive, to shall-issue carry for your protection, nuclear power with dividends back in your pocket, and more. All come with built-in sunsets and circuit-breakers to keep them accountable.

| # | Policy | Key Win for You |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Universal School Choice** | $15k per child, so you can pick any accredited school that fits your family. |
| 4 | **Shall-Issue Concealed Carry** | Self-defense as your civil right + $200 training credit to keep you safe. |
| 9 | **17% Flat Consumption Tax** | Tax what you spend, not what you earn—with a prebate for essentials to ease your burden. |
| 14 | **All-In Nuclear + Carbon Dividend** | 200 reactors by 2040; every carbon dollar returned directly to you. |
| 18 | **Prediction Markets + Citizen Juries** | Let data beat out dogma; 100 random citizens like you veto overreach. |

## Why It Works for You
- **Self-Correcting**: Every rule includes a sunset, circuit-breaker, or opt-out—so if it doesn't serve you, it's gone.
- **State Labs**: Hot-button issues (like abortion or marijuana) turn into real-world experiments where data decides what's best for communities like yours.
- **No Legacy Bloat**: Government's role? Shield you, unblock opportunities, and step aside—focusing on what matters to you.
