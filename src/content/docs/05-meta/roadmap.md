title: Guard Pact Rollout Roadmap  
description: 2026–2030 Phased Adoption with Circuit-Breakers

## Explanation  
The Guard Pact is **not a platform** — it’s a **self-correcting operating system**. Adoption follows **evidence velocity**: start with 90%+ resonance policies, use state labs as sandboxes, scale via prediction-market validation.

## How-To  
1. **Pre-Launch (2025–Q1 2026)** – Publish site, recruit 10k Meta-Rational Citizens, fund 3 prediction markets on #1, #4, #18.  
2. **Phase 1 (2026)** – Charter Cities Act (#17) passes. 5 zones live (TX, FL, CA, CO, PA).  
3. **Phase 2 (2027)** – Pass “Liberty-First Five”: #1, #4, #8, #11, #18.  
4. **Phase 3 (2028)** – If state-lab metrics beat national avg by 10%, introduce #9 (Flat Tax) + #14 (Nuclear).  
5. **Phase 4 (2029)** – AI + Tech block (#12, #15, #16) if unemployment <5%.  
6. **Phase 5 (2030)** – Full 18 + State Lab convergence.  
*Circuit-breaker*: Any phase auto-pauses if public approval <60% ( Gallup poll, 3-quarter rolling).

## Tutorial  
[Hypothetical: Austin Charter City runs #1 (School Choice) → NAEP +15% → Florida copies → national bill in 2028.]

## Reference  
| Phase | Policies | Success Metric | Sunset Trigger |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| 1 | #17 | 5 zones live | <3 zones by 2027 |  
| 2 | #1, #4, #8, #11, #18 | 80% parent satisfaction | <60% → revert |  

**Prediction Market:** “Resolves YES if 3+ Essential Points pass Congress by 2029.”
