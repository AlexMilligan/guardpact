The State Lab Doctrine is the Guard Pact's elegant solution for contentious issues that paralyze the nation. Instead of imposing one-size-fits-all federal mandates, it leverages the 50 states as "laboratories of democracy."

**The core principle is simple: Federal silence. State experiments. Data wins.**

Any issue that fails to align with the [5 High-Level Goals](/explanation/five-high-level-goals/) at a national level is removed from federal jurisdiction. This prevents untested, top-down policies and allows local communities to innovate.

States are empowered to run live A/B tests on policies using the Guard Pact's toolkit:
- **[Charter Cities](/essential-points/#17-charter-cities-act):** Opt-in zones for radical experimentation.
- **[Prediction Markets + Citizen Juries](/essential-points/#18-prediction-markets-citizen-juries):** Data-driven evaluation and citizen oversight.
- **Hard Circuit-Breakers:** Automatic sunset clauses if a policy fails to meet its stated goals.

This framework transforms intractable moral debates into empirical questions. It allows us to discover what *works* by observing real-world outcomes, rather than arguing about what *should* work.

### State Lab Issues (13 Topics)

Here are the initial 13 issues designated for the State Lab Doctrine. Each one is removed from federal control and handed to states, with a clear mandate to experiment and measure.

| # | Topic | State Rule | Circuit-Breaker |
|---|---|---|---|
| **19.1** | **Abortion** | Charter City A/B (e.g., 12-week vs birth). Prediction market on maternal mortality. | **↑5% maternal deaths** or **↓10% teen fertility** → auto-sunset. |
| **19.2** | **Marriage Age/Definition** | Cities test 16/18/21. Jury re-approves every 3 yrs. | **↑15% teen pregnancy** → revert. |
| **19.3** | **Recreational Marijuana** | Prediction market on DUI + overdose deaths. | **↑10% combined** in 2 yrs → ban. |
| **19.4** | **Physician-Assisted Suicide** | 100-citizen jury approval every 3 yrs. | **↑5% total suicide rate** → moratorium. |
| **19.5** | **Gambling** | Charter zone vs no-bet county. | **↑20% bankruptcy rate** → revert. |
| **19.6** | **Prostitution** | Legal brothel pilot. Market on trafficking arrests. | **↑15% trafficking** → ban. |
| **19.7** | **Death Penalty** | Jury re-approves per crime every 5 yrs. | **>1% wrongful convictions** → moratorium. |
| **19.8** | **Animal Ag Rules** | Vegan zone vs CAFO zone. | **↑20% food prices** → revert. |
| **19.9** | **Vaccine Mandates (Non-Pandemic)** | Jury approval only if outbreak >1% mortality. | Auto-sunset post-crisis. |
| **19.10** | **Zoning/Density** | YIMBY vs NIMBY cities. | **↓15% housing cost** → scale winner. |
| **19.11** | **Electoral Systems** | RCV vs jungle primary pilots. | **↑10% turnout + ↓ incumbent lock** → adopt top 2. |
| **19.12** | **Trans Sports (K-12/College)** | Open vs bio-sex leagues in charter schools. | **<10% participation gap** → scale. |
| **19.13** | **Reparations** | Local cash pilot. Market on homeownership gap. | **<5% gap closure in 5 yrs** → sunset. |

This is not about avoiding hard conversations. It's about having *better* ones—grounded in evidence, accountable to citizens, and designed for discovery.
